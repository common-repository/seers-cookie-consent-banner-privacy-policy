== FAQ ==
Maybe there’s a lot of questions on your mind. See the FAQ on the main website and the setup guide for implementing the seers cookie consent plugin.

= The Cookie Banner is not displaying?

If your banner isn’t showing, please make sure:

1. After you installed and activated the plugin from WordPress, you should also activate it through our wp plugin settings by providing your email address, agreeing to terms and clicking the Activate button.
2. Please be patient. It can take up to 24 hours for the complete scan of your website after activating the plugin.
3. Check whether you have switched the banner toggle off in the plugin settings. (or unchecked the banner checkbox in the Seers Account Dashboard of cookie banner settings)

We hope that you have successfully displayed the banner on your website after following the steps mentioned above.

If you are still unable to see your banner or for any further assistance, please contact us at [support@seersco.com](mailto:support@seersco.com).

= This plugin blocks all the cookies?
Yes, the plugin blocks all the cookies except the ones marked as necessary. If you haven’t switched prior consent ON, then all the cookies will be automatically stored until a user disables those. In the other case, when the prior consent is switched ON, all the cookies will be blocked until the user allows them.

= Do this plugins provide full compliance with the law?
No, as a cookie consent plugin, it is difficult to know anything about specific circumstances on your website. This plugin can help you in the overall compliance process but can’t guarantee you full compliance with the GDPR, CCPA, LGPD and other regulations.

If you are looking for a privacy expert related to your website, you can always visit [seersco.com](https://seersco.com) or contact us at [support@seersco.com](mailto:support@seersco.com).

= Is the Cookie Consent plugin by Seers a Free product?
Cookie consent by Seers gives Standard features for free with a Promo code to WordPress Platform users only.

Upgrade to [Premium](https://seersco.com/price-plan) to get extra features.

= Do I need to edit my current WordPress theme?
No, Seers cookie consent is compatible with all word press themes.

= Is our website’s data legally safe with Seers Cookie Consent?

For more FAQs, please visit [Cookie Knowledge Bank](https://seerssupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us) and for any query, [contact us](https://seersco.com/contact).

= Does Real Cookie Banner find all cookies on my website automatically?
A cookie scanner could, but it will simply find cookies and will not be able to assess whether the personal data is being used legally. Furthermore, finding all cookies is quite complex, and most "cookie scanners" do not find all of them.

= When do I need a Cookie Notice?
Seers GDPR/CCPA Cookie Consent will automatically decide this based on the regulations of the region or sub-regions from which the majority of your visitors come.
In terms of the CCPA, you must always disclose which cookies you are using, but there is no obligation in asking for consent.

= Does the Cookie Notice make my site fully compliant with GDPR?
No, technical compliance capabilities such as automatic script blocking, consent purpose categories, and consent record storage are not available in the plugin-only version. Only the Cookie Compliance integration gives you access to these features.
